# Maven Turbo Builder

See presentation [board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLYUPRas=/?share_link_id=929861907417)

This extension suggests different Maven reactor scheduler implementation via custom Builder.
By default, to build any module in a multi-module project Maven first resolves and executes all phases of upstream
dependencies. This is a fundamental behaviour which is built-in and strongly enforced because of back compatibility.
This significantly reduces possible concurrency and in a multi-core system CPU cores are loaded unevenly. To enhance
parallelism this extension does two things:
* changes the order of `*test*` phases and `*package*`, `package` is executed before `test` (not after as default)
* schedules module build of downstream dependencies when `package` phase was executed, not waiting for all phases (like
  `test`, `integration-test`, `install`, `deploy`, etc.)

As a result, depending on the particular project, this boosts the build and increases CPU utilization to maximum.

See this example of three modules depending on each other: `test-utils`, `core` and `app`. While this project is
multi-module, Maven by default will build it in a single core even with `-T1C` parameter. This extension will
schedule it in a more efficient way:

The phases are now reordered:

You can check the order of phases with Turbo builder enabled:
```shell
mvn org.codehaus.mojo:buildplan-maven-plugin:list -b turbo
```
the `package` phase now goes before `test-compile` and `test`:
```

```

To set up the extension add to `.mvn/extensions.xml` in the root of the project
```xml
<extensions>
    <extension>
        <!-- https://github.com/maven-turbo-reactor/maven-turbo-builder -->
        <groupId>com.github.seregamorph</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-turbo-builder</artifactId>
        <version>1.3</version>
    </extension>
</extensions>
```

To run build with custom Builder:
```shell
mvn clean verify -b turbo -T1C
```
To enable this extension by default, add line to `.mvn/maven.config` under root of your project:
```
-bturbo
-T1C
```
Note, that for many setups, e.g. Apple MacBook Pro, `-T0.5C` can be more efficient and faster than `-T1C` (as only half
of the CPU cores are powerful).

Example adoption:
* [Maven Surefire, in combination with Maven Surefire Cached extension](https://github.com/seregamorph/maven-surefire/pull/2) (20% faster build + cache complementary)
* [Maven Surefire, in combination with Develocity Extension](https://github.com/seregamorph/maven-surefire/pull/1) (20% faster build + cache complementary)

Compatibility:
* this extension can be used with [Maven Surefire Cached Extension](https://github.com/seregamorph/maven-surefire-cached)
* this extension can be used with [Apache Maven Build Cache Extension](https://maven.apache.org/extensions/maven-build-cache-extension/)
* this extension can be used with [Develocity Maven Extension](https://gradle.com/help/maven-extension/)
* this extension can be used with [Dynamic Test Distribution for Maven](https://github.com/seregamorph/test-distribution)
* IDEA can work in "delegate to Maven" build and run tests
* extension supports `-am` (`--also-make`) and `-rf` (`--resume-from`) build flags

Supported versions:
* `Java` 8+
* `Maven` 3.6.x-3.10.x, 4.0.x
* all standard plugins like `maven-surefire-plugin`, `maven-failsafe-plugin` and other
* plugins like Jacoco are also supported, but potentially may require to change the goal execution phase
